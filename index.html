                <h4>Four people need to cross a rickety bridge at night. They have one flashlight to share and can cross no more than two at a time. They all walk at different speeds: 
                    one can cross the bridge in 1 minute, another in 2 minutes, another in 5 minutes, and the slowest in 10 minutes. 
                    When two people cross the bridge together, they must move at the slower person's pace, and the flashlight must be carried each time the bridge is crossed. 
                    What is the shortest amount of time it takes for all four people to cross the bridge?</h4>
